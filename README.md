# Flynn is an open source Platform as a Service

Flynn is designed to run anything that can run on Linux, not just stateless web apps. Flynn comes with highly available database appliances, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

Flynn was originally built by Prime Directive Inc at https://github.com/flynn/flynn. This is a community forked version of Flynn and is a work in progress. The goal is to update it to run on modern Linux distros and with modern dependencies.
